Pre Live 1.27 (Previous Versoins)
------------------------
Employee Screen:
- The post code in the employees section Now allows more characters


Reports:
- Sat Charge appeard in Sun charge on the Validation report - This is now Fixed

- The Follow up report now does not show any records that have a "week ending if late" date 
  As these wont need following up anyway. 

- When you now produce the Validation report it will only show "L" status records 
  i.e. it will only show records that are locked, as any unlocked recordes are deemed to be un complete 


The Main PLAN screen:
- When The follow up button is pressed to follow up workers from one week to the next it now does not 
  copy over to the following week any records that has "Week ending if late" date 
  (the reason for this is beacuse any "week ending if late" records shoudl be payrolled in that week and are 
   only manually placed onto the following week if the pay issue is still not resolved. 

- On the plan you can now filter by client - this has been included so that you can just see all temps that are in at the one client only. 
  You can then filter on the next client ect, - this makes it easier for when your entering hours on a Tuesday 
  (Note to get it back to see the whole plan you would need to close the plan screen and re open)
 

TIPS / THINGS TO REMEMBER 

The system does not like blanks!!! if in doubt place a 0
The system does not auto save - every change you make enure your press "Save" 
If you go into a record on the plan and change the Rate schedule or job cat or client you may need to re enter the pay and hours - just remember to allways double check if you are ammendeding a record
